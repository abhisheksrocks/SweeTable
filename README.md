# For Developers

This project explores on the idea of making a single-page website, with support for dynamic URLs with just Github Pages, using Vanilla JS. Let's understand this better with an example:-

When a user opens the URL:-

```
  https://somewebsite.com/with/some/url?that=can&have=queryParams
```

Traditionally, there is a web-server(like NodeJS) in the backend that handles the routing, i.e. looks for which file to serve the user based on the URL parameters. This project aims to utilize Github Pages and Vanilla JavaScript to implement this routing logic on the client's side(Client Side Routing).
